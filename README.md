# C++ MATHS LIBRARY
This project was created as an experiment, to see if maths functions in C++ could be improved upon with speed - and how much this would affect the integrity of the solution.
In this project, I have provided a document detailing how I calculated each mathematical function, using differentiation with Taylor's Series.
This was initially with the intention of integrating into a custom game's engine. Similarly, the methods I chose to implement were inspired by the Unity.Math library.

You can view the [document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQz6-cXwRFIddLG5fhwqN2dVveNj2Rbs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104537967011156232269&rtpof=true&sd=true), detailing my investigation, and the mathematical functions.
